# poke-seacher

A cli tool for pokeapi using javascript. I made it as a quick project to learn how to make my own global npm script.

## Requirements
1. NodeJS
2. Internet Access
3. A shell/cmd environment

## Usage
The core of the app is in ./lib/pokesearch.mjs. If you want to test it you could do so by typing in your terminal

``` 
    node ./lib/pokesearch.mjs [pokename] [pokeproperty from json]
```
